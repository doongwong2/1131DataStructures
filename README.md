# 1131DataStructures
I am one of the tutors for this course, some code to help.
For some reason, my sequence is different from the actual sequence, but some questions are identical.  

In hindsight, using C++ is the more comfortable method, but this can only be feltafter agonizing how to do so in C.    
I do not think I could declare a vector struct in C ever again XD
